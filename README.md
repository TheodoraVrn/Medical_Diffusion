# Medical Image Applications of Diffusion Models
Project for the advanced artificial intelligence class in NTUA (2023-2024).

## Project
The medical tutorials are based on the generative models of MONAI. MONAI is a PyTorch-based, open-source framework for deep learning in healthcare imaging, part of PyTorch Ecosystem. 
## Tutorials
* Image synthesis with Diffusion Models
  * Training a 2D Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
  * Comparing different noise schedulers
  * Using a 2D DDPM to inpaint images
* Image synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models
  * Training a 2D Latent Diffusion Model
